# JavaVisuals_project

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

This project uses Java's powerful capabilities - flexibility, speed and security, for creating dynamic data visualizations that can help in gaining meaningful insights and have informed decisions.

It uses the Swing framework for generating and building feature rich GUI components and JFreechart library to create graphical representations of data that is feed by the user to the GUI's table.
